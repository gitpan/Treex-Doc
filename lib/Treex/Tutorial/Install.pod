=head1 NAME

Treex::Tutorial::Install - Installing the Treex NLP framework


=head1 VERSION

version 0.07297

=head1 TWO WAYS TO GET TREEX

You can download Treex from CPAN L<http://www.cpan.org> or from the SVN repository.
However, so far only the latter is usable, because  
only the core modules (C<Treex::Core>) were released on CPAN
and to do something interesting with Treex you need also some other modules.

=head2 Downloading and Installing Treex from CPAN

You can install Treex and its dependecies from shell using the C<cpan> tool:

    cpan Treex::Core

In future, there will be also distributions for the analysis (and synthesis)
of several languages: C<Treex::EN> for English, C<Treex::DE> for German,
C<Treex::CS> for Czech etc. 

=head2 Downloading and Installing Treex from SVN

Treex is being developed in TectoMT subversion repository.
For read-only access you can use:

    cd ~
    svn --username public co https://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/tectomt_devel/trunk tectomt
    # password is "public"

Install the needed Perl modules dependencies: 

    cpan Moose MooseX::Getopt MooseX::NonMoose MooseX::Params::Validate\
         MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor Readonly Treex::PML\
         File::Slurp File::HomeDir File::Path File::ShareDir\
         LWP::Simple Data::Dumper Module::Reload Locale::Language\
         Parse::RecDescent Cwd Scalar::Util autodie String::Util

Add Treex modules to your C<$PERLLIB> so perl can find them,
and the C<treex> script to your C<$PATH> so you can execute it from shell.  
Add the following lines to your C<~/.bashrc>:

    export TMT_ROOT=${HOME}/tectomt/
    export PATH="${TMT_ROOT%/}/treex/bin:$PATH"
    export PERL5LIB="${TMT_ROOT%/}/treex/lib:${TMT_ROOT%/}/libs/other:$PERL5LIB"
    export PERLLIB=$PERL5LIB   

And C<source ~/.bashrc> or open a new terminal. Check that it works by running:

    treex -h 

Some Treex applications use huge pre-trained models, dictionaries etc.
These resources are stored in an unversioned directory C<$TMT_ROOT/share>
and they should be automatically downloaded when running the respective application.
You should create the empty directory or symlink.

    mkdir $TMT_ROOT/share
    #ln -s /mnt/my_big_disk/tectomt_share $TMT_ROOT/share

Similarly, some applications need a directory for temporary files.

    ln -s /tmp $TMT_ROOT/tmp
    #mkdir $TMT_ROOT/tmp

=head2 Installing other tools

=head3 TrEd

For visualization of trees it is beneficial to install TrEd from
L<http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~pajas/tred>.
Install it to the C<$TMT_ROOT/share/tred> directory (or symlink).
Now you can check if you can run the Treex-modified version of TrEd:

    ttred

=head3 XS-based perl modules

Morce is a high-quality part-of-speech tagger for English.
You can install it by: 

    cd $TMT_ROOT/libs/packaged/Morce-English
    less INSTALL
    # follow the instruction in INSTALL

In the same way, you can install C<CzechMorpho> and C<Morce-Czech> (in this order).
